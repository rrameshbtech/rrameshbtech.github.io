Hai there!

A near real life story
- TL - Nalan - trying to sort out a tech decision which needs to be taken along with tech leads
- His schedule is full for the days, so as everyone else
- Dont have time to create any diagrams or 6 page memo
- Not sure about who to be part of the meeting. Adds it as open meeting
- A lot of choas in the meeting. no decision taken.
- People took time to come to context and deviate quite often
- meeting ends with no decision and no body have a clue of what could be the next action item.


How it is viewed -> Meetings are evil
Is it really?
One of the most misused process is meeting.
Just I can ask people to join meetings, I schedule one

Meeting are now like a hammer in carpender's hand

Duration
- Keep it short
- Max 30 mins meeting. Nope it should be 25 mins for giving breathing space for people between meetings.
