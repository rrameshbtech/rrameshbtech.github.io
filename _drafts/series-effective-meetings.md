Hello friends!

We are in the decade of AI and there are lots of buzz around how it is going to disrupt the way the world is working today, especially the software industry. Almost everyone agree that there is an impact. The open questions are only where, which & how it will be. Despite of all these buzz, I still believe the territory of people is still untouched, where the core business operates. People think, create ideas, solve problems, make plans & much more. As kent Beck quotes below, software industry is no expection.

`Programming is 90% thinking and 10% typing` - Kent Beck in [Extreme programming explained](https://www.amazon.in/Extreme-Programming-Explained-Embrace-Change/dp/0321278658)

This 90% percentage thinking is not just one brain's work but it demands a lots of  discussions, decision makings & agreements. This primarily happens in what is called `Syncronous meetings` or just `meeting`.

No. No. Don' run away. 

Like you I too hate them. But are they that evil? If yes, why we all have a lot of meetings?

I would say "Meetings are neutral, it becomes god or evil based on how is it executed". So we do not hate meeting, we only hate recurring, badly managed, no outcome driven meetings.

In this article, I will share the tips & tricks I curated & practicing to make the meeting interesting and valuables.

Let's start with a small story.
## A Nalan story
A near real life story
- TL - Nalan - trying to sort out a tech decision which needs to be taken along with tech leads
- His schedule is full for the days, so as everyone else
- Dont have time to create any diagrams or 6 page memo
- Not sure about who to be part of the meeting. Adds it as open meeting
- A lot of choas in the meeting. no decision taken.
- People took time to come to context and deviate quite often
- meeting ends with no decision and no body have a clue of what could be the next action item.


How it is viewed -> Meetings are evil
Is it really?
One of the most misused process is meeting.
Just I can ask people to join meetings, I schedule one

Meeting are now like a hammer in carpender's hand

Duration
- Keep it short
- Max 30 mins meeting. Nope it should be 25 mins for giving breathing space for people between meetings.
