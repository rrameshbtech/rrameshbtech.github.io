Hai there!
How it is viewed -> Meetings are evil
Is it really?
One of the most misused process is meeting.
Just I can ask people to join meetings, I schedule one

Meeting are now like a hammer in carpender's hand

Duration
- Keep it short
- Max 30 mins meeting. Nope it should be 25 mins for giving breathing space for people between meetings.
