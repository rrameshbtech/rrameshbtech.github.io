Hai there!

Some of you might thought the title would be a click bait. But trust me, when I thought about writing my recent experiences in a project, this is the first and only title struck my mind. Though it felt dramatic, I chose this as it clearly conveys state of my mind during that project. The discussion of good code vs bad code might have born the next minute the first computer programmer typed his first line of code. But it is still hot, relevant and worth discussing.

There are tons of articles and books about refactoring and writing good code. Masters like Martin Fowler, Uncle Bob and a lot of people wrote and talked a lot on writing good code. So we are not going to discuss about them. In stead, lets see how to you and your team when you had to work badly written code aka a ticking time bomb.

### Declare it's a time bomb and it's ticking
It is very important especially when it was built by your peers.

### Set the expectations correct including you
You wear safety gears by setting right expectations with others. 

Don't blame yourself or others for working in a bad code. Train yourself for the bad code and 

### build the safety net

### Cut one wire at a time

### Try to snooze first

## Is your code base a ticking time bomb?

### Lack of empaty

Let's go ahead with asking a series of questions to understand how good our code is.
### Am I reading with out much cognitive load?

### Can I predict the intention of the code with out much hassel?

### Am I confident to make a push a change at the end of the day?

## What makes your code a ticking time bomb?

### Bad names
In early days most of the indian movies have this scene where the hero deactivates the time bomb at the very last moment to explode. Luckily our heros know that red wires is the one to cut and saves the world and some super lucky heros gets time bombs with on/off switches which makes their life easier (How kind these villans are?). But just think what if the red wire or switch is not the one deactivates the bomb but bursts it. Are we, the software programmers kind enough like Indian movie villans?

### Tangled wires or mixed responsibilities

### Timer with no timer or unpredictability

### The unwanted wires or commented or non functioning code
cut the crap

### No box or Schemaless
Now a days with the boom of No SQL DBs, schemaless became a choice No.1. But why? Most never asks this quesiton. Any choice comes with a trade-off are we aware of it when we are making it schemaless. Do we really nead it?
As Martin fowler says programming is 90% decision making 10% typing. Chosing correct data types make the decision making a lot easier.

### No Manual
