The posts I came across about World Mental Health Day are the catalyst for me to write this one. Even after all these medical and technological advancements, metal health lacks it's place in discussion forums. Still most of the people feels uncomfortable to share with others. It might be because the fear of come it will be received. Based on my observations, mostly when somebody share about their struggles with mental health issues, either it perceived as taboo to talk outside or made fun on it. This aggrrevates the problem and makes it more intense. Nowadays a lot of initiatives taken at various levels to create a safer & helpful environment for people to share their mental health issues and ask for help.

Here is my journey with mental health issues and my learnings.

## Realisation
As a common Indian family man, I was navigating between personal and professional life chores everyday. There were no time left for munching the memories and analyse what I can do better. There were some issues in my project and I scheduled a call with one of my manager to discuss about it. During the conversation, he suddenly asked, "Are you okay? Are your feeling burnt out?". I don't know what made him ask this question. But this made think what I am going through. In a faraction of second, my mind rewinded the recent past and I spondaniously replied "Yes. I am.". That moment did not only changed our conversation but also my life. We breifly discussed about the issues and he suggested for counselling.

This conversation stayed in my head and made my ponder what I was going through. After some pondering I realised how deeply trapped I was and at the same time I taken aback how I missed to recognise inspite of my recent years I spent taking care of my mother who was going through mental health issues and regular visits to psychologists and counsellers. Some of the potential reasons for oversight of my state.

* I have never given a quality time to retrospect myself.
* Whenever I felt it hard, I thought it is normal and everyone going through the same.
* Even I wanted to talk about it earlier, I did not know to whom to talk to.

## Resurrection
Easy said than done. It was a long such a travel. I still coming out of it. It is a never ending process. We have to keep retrospect and take necessary antitodes to get ourself in better mental health. But they all started with a simple step. Talking to others especially your closer ones. After my realisation of what I was going through, I went to my family and explained what I was going through. This instance opened the gate of resurrection.

Then there was no looking back. Yeah. I want to say that. But sadly, it is not true. It is a continious process. We have be vigilent and interate analyse-recognise-action of what are we going through in regular intervals. 

Now when I look back, thought it was not a smooth ride, it gives me a lot of confidence and faith that I could takcle and come out of any situations. Here are some of learnings which are helping me in this journey.

## When you go through hard times or you think so
### Talk to others
Sharing heals. Yes. It's true. It relaxes and builds faith. I usually choose my closer ones to talk to. It can be anybody from your family, friends or even from your workplace. The common mistake is waiting for right person to talk. It is better to talk to somebody than waiting for the right person. Most of the time we won't know who will be the right person untill we start sharing. Some simple tricks I follow.

* Do not delay.
* Talk to anyone in your circle who is available.
* Explain what you go through. Do not interpret.

### Ask for help
We shy of asking help. Most of the times, we do not ask for help because we think that we will be judged and assumed weeker. But in my experience, it did not change anything. In contrary, they were eager to find a way to help me.

Another common mistake we do is underestimating our issues and overestimating our ability to solve. Until my manager asked whether I am okay, I assumed that my issues are normal and I can fix them myself. But once I started retrospecting, I realised I need help. It can be your family or professionals.

It is good to seek professional help sooner than delaying by juding whether our issues are big enough or not. Nowadays most of the companies provide `Employee Assist Programs`. It is a good place to start with. If you do not have such option, we (in India) have Tele MANAS (An Indian government initiative). You can dial 14416 or 1-800 8914416 for help.

### Be kind to yourself
The greatest gift we have is ourself. As it got it with out any effort, sadly we fail to respect it. We being existing with sound mind and body is the very important thing than anything else in our life. Let's see how to appriciate the first one.

Unfortunately mind is not visible, so we care it lesser. Like body, our mind needs good food to stay healthy. Self appriciation is the protean to your mind. But how and when to appriciate? We should appriciate for our every action. Usually we see success or failure as the possible outcomes to our action, but there is an another important one. It is the learning we got from the action.

Be it success or failure, let's celebrate for our learnings. It appriciates your effrots irrespective of the outcome. You does not need to compare yourself with others for it. Because, you are unique and you learned something which makes it success and a reason to celebrate yourself.

## When somebody asks for help
Being in country like India with strong treditional beliefs and treatment gap of more than 80 per cent, we should have basic awarness about menthal health especially someone with such condition approches your for help. Based on my experience and learning as a care giver for a parent more than a decade, I gave my top 3 learnings below.

### Just listen
An unjudgmental and uninterruptive listening is highly a effective way to convey the person that you care. Most of the times, they expect somebody to hear what they go through and show compassion, nothing more.

During the initial days, my discussions with my mom were a disaster. I was clueless and blaming my mom why don't she act rationally. But I solowly understood that she never wanted the solution but somebody to listen and understand what she is going through. Once I understood, things changed quickly and it consoled both my mom and me.

### It's okay
This helped me a lot to comfort the person who were expressing what they go through. Most of the times they think, their condition or suffering is their fault. This intense their worries and puts them into an cyclic blame game. This sentence helped me show my empaty and make them realise that they are not alone.

### Don't blame yourself
As an amateur, we should be aware of our limits to help the person who is in need. Especially when the person is our closer one, we are emotionally bound and desperate to help them. When we are unable to help them, we start blaming ourself. This will sometimes lead to bad mental health. So always be aware of what we could help and guide them to get professional help.

You are unqie. Appriciate and celebrate everything you do. There is no failure. Either it is success or small success, because there something to learn in every outcome. You do not wait to be happy until the life is hard anymore. Start celebrating yourself now on.
