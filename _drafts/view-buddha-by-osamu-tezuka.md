Hello friends,

Though I read comics regularly, my comics rack is dominated by [italian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_comics) & [franco-belgian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bande_dessin%C3%A9e) comics like [BlueBerry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blueberry_(comics)), [Tex Willer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tex_Willer), [Lucky Luke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucky_Luke), [XIII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XIII_(comics)) & others. This is due to the impact of [Muthu Comics]() in [Tamilnadu](). Perhaps in recent days I started reading other comics too. Thanks to evolving Indian comic space. Manga was still an unexplored teritory for me. For a long time, I had [Buddha by Tezuka]() one in my shopping cart, but never had guts to buy it (Price & my wife's reaction to it might be the primary reason). Finally, one day Amazon showed me the mercy and a major price drop in the box set. I just placed the order before my rational thinking kicks in and stops me from buying it.

Now lets get into the journey. The have a reason to call reading Buddha is a journey. It is an obsolute adventure ride. You should try it at least once. May be a disclaimer before we start, I do not call this as review. I am not a professional reviewer or do not have enough knowledge to slice & dice every part of this book. May be for any other. So I would call it as my perspective and experience. This is not because fear about any conflicts but I think proper review needs a dense analysis as a respect to the creation.

## Story
As the name implies, it is the story of The Buddha from his birth till his death. As world citizen, most of us would have heard the story of The Buddha in glimps at least. In gist, it is same. But this manga is not 100% true to fact story of The Buddha, but a fun filled play of [Tezuka]() with time. Tezuka introduces fictional characters every now and then in this series. Even at Tezuka himself do a cameo apperances at times. So if you want to read the real history of The Buddha and understand his gospel, better you taken diversion and there are a lot other options. But if you want to do a adventurous ride with The Buddha. Bugle in. Tezuke is ready to take you to the adventures ride of your lifetime.
