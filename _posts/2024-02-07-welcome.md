Hey there!

Welcome to my web space. To be frank, I'm not quite sure how to properly welcome you here. As a regular reader (or perhaps just an intermittent one), I've been contemplating writing blogs or articles about my views and learnings for some time now. However, as you might have guessed, it's been indefinitely postponed. I got into writer's block even before pressing a single key.

Whenever I gather the courage to start writing, I often find myself questioning whether I truly have anything meaningful to share, and will it worth anyone's time in our fast-paced world. After much contemplation, I tend to ditch my ideas before they even take shape. Sometimes they make it as far as becoming draft notes before I get drowned into my fears.

But as they say, all things must come to an end, even my fear. At some point, I managed to overcome my fear of opinions, failure, and imperfection. I'm not exactly sure when or how I found the courage to do so. Perhaps it was during my battles with midlife crises, or maybe it was something else entirely. Reflecting on how I managed to break through the invisible glass of fear, I realized that it all boiled down to the fear of the unknown outcome. What if I don't get it right? What if my English isn't good enough? What if no one finds it interesting? But then I asked myself, does any of that really matter? The answer is a big No. If my intention is just sharing, nothing else really matters, even the outcome.

So here I am, ready to share whatever I deem worth sharing. My sole intention is just sharing my experiences as true as they are to me.

Now, what can you expect to find here? To be honest, even I'm not entirely sure yet, despite having a few ideas in mind. Topics may range from technology to books, movies, and beyond. So, expect the unexpected, much like me.

Until the next post, take care and bye for now!
