Greetings! I'm Ramesh Ramalingam, but you can call me Ramesh. With over 17 years of experience in software development, I've been deeply involved in web-related technologies and team leadership. Currently, I serve as a Lead Consultant at Thoughtworks Technology Pvt. India Ltd., where my passion lies in crafting innovative solutions that prioritize user-centricity.

Outside of coding, you'll often find me immersed in the captivating worlds of Tamil and English literature, exploring both fiction and non-fiction works. The kid in me still finds joy in diving into comics (franco-belgian, indian & more). When it comes to movies, I enjoy a wide range of genres, from fast-paced thrillers to thought-provoking cinema that challenges the status quo. While I may have a preference for certain languages in books, I'm eager to break down any language barriers when it comes to film.

Join me on this journey as I share my experiences, views & learnings about my work, readings & movies.
